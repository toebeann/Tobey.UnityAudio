# Tobey's Unity Audio patcher for BepInEx

A universal BepInEx patcher to enable/disable Unity's built-in audio for any Unity game. Primarily useful for games where Unity's audio engine has been disabled by the game developers due to using a third-party audio engine, such as FMOD.

Includes a BepInEx plugin for in-game configuration with [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager).

## Usage

In most cases you won't need to do much beyond plopping the contents of the downloaded .zip from [the releases page](https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.UnityAudio/releases) into your game folder (after installing [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), of course).

However, in some cases, manual configuration is required. The below configuration options can be edited in-game with [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (some options require enabling "Advanced settings" to view them), or by editing the `Tobey.UnityAudio.cfg` file generated in `BepInEx\config`:

```
